## web-scraping-using-python

Hello, I did this web scraping project in the second semester of the university for the programming course.
The tkinter library is used for the graphical interface, and what this code does is process the data in the recruitment section of the Quera website.
Considering that I wrote this code in 2021 and probably the html structure of the quera site has changed by now, the code does not output, but if I design it with a new structure, it will be effective.
Thank you for being with me.
I hope this content is useful for you
